    "\n",
    "Prognostics and health management *(PHM)* is an engineering process of failure prevention and predicting reliability and remaining useful lifetime *(RUL)*. It has become an important component of many engineering systems and products since it is very crucial to every industry to to detect anomalies, malfunctions and failures before they can damage the whole environment, including the system and the users, and may cause high costs for repairs on un-scheduled maintenance. Inspite of its main objective which is to ensure safety for users, it provides state of the heath of the components and systems which can create a scheduled list to program maintenance before damage. These maintenance tasks become therefore evidence-based scheduled There are two main categories of applications of PHM :<br><br>\n",
    "$\\bullet$ __Off-line PHM__ : It concerns systems where safety is not critical and the ratio of failures is very small. <br>\n",
    "$\\bullet$ __Real-time PHM__ : It concerns systems where safety is critical and that demand on-board monitoring capability. <br><br>\n",
    "There are two approaches that help define the health of a system as the extent of deviation or degradation from its expected typical operating performance which has to be determined accurately to prevent the failures : __Data-driven__ and __Model-driven__. The former, as its name indicates, is based on data collection via real capturing or simulations based on theoretically-proved models. The latter is rather based on models that describe the system functionalities and specific knowledge.<br><br>\n",

    "__In this challenge__, we would rather focus on the data-driven approach which uses monitored and historical data to learn the systems behaviours and perform prognostics. It is suitable for systems which are complex and with behaviours that cannot be assessed and deribed from first principles. It uses many algorithms that are quicker to implement and which are computationally more efficient to run compared with other techniques. The data is usually obtained via sensors. One problem of this approach is that the confidence level in the predictions depends on the available historical and empirical data. Besides, it requires some threshold values to be put by the operator which can sometimes be non-trivial.<br>\n",
    "Most efforts are focusing on data-driven approaches reflects the desire to harvest low-hanging fruit as compared to model-based approaches. Yet, it can be difficult to gain an access to statistically significant amounts of run-to-failure data and common metrics that allow a comparison between different approaches. Thus, a system model had been established in order to generate run-to failure data that can be utilized to develop, train and test prognostic algorithms. However, before entering into details of system modeling, let's start by introducing the business case we will be considereing for this challenge."

    "__Airlines__ seem to be successful businesses with strong management. Nonetheless, they literally bear high costs due to delays and cancellations that includes expenses on maintenance and compensations to travelers stuck in airports. Besides, they suffer from a non neglectable probability of failing on-flight accidents which can lead to disasters. With nearly 30 percent of the total delay time caused by unplanned maintenance and at least 200 accident per year (including fatal accidents) , predictive analytics applied to fleet technical support is a reasonable solution.<br><br>\n",
    "Predictive maintenance solutions are used to better manage data from aircraft health monitoring sensors. Knowing an aircraft’s current technical condition through alerts, notifications, and reports, employees can spot issues pointing at possible malfunction and replace parts proactively. Executives and team leads, in turn, can receive updates on maintenance operations, get data on tool and part inventory, and expenses via dashboards.<br><br>\n",
    "With applied predictive maintenance, an airline can reduce expenses connected with expedited transportation of parts, overtime compensation for crews, and unplanned maintenance. If a technical problem did occur, maintenance teams could react to it faster with workflow organization software. The solution consists of analyzing data and metadata regarding detected maintenance activity. It helps engineers quickly evaluate a situation, for instance, to find out if this failure happened for the first time; if not, what can be done to fix it and how much time did it take to solve it previous times.<br><br>\n",

Equipment failures still account for around 20% of aircraft losses, despite improvements in design and manufacturing quality. While engines are significantly more reliable today than they were half a century ago, they still occasionally suffer catastrophic failures.<br><br>\n",

In the 1950s, for example, the introduction of high-flying, pressurised jet aircraft introduced an entirely new hazard – metal fatigue brought on by the hull’s pressurisation cycle. Several high-profile disasters caused by this problem led to the withdrawal of the de Havilland Comet aircraft model, pending design changes.<br><br>\n",

Sometimes, these issues are being worked on even as passengers board the plane, meaning the delay the passenger experiences might take place entirely on the tarmac. Other times, in the case of larger issues, your airline might make the call to switch planes entirely for the safety of everyone involved.
